							Solid mechanics covers a vast area of research and engineering, in which I touched some fields in the last 10 years. Most of my focus was on fracture mechanics and material properties under various loading conditions. I had opportunities to study and work with brittle and ductile materials using experimental and numerical methods. My bachelors was in Aerospace engineering which contained mainly four engineering streams - structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, propulsion and flight dynamics - among which one had to choose and focus on a particular area for masters. I was more inclined to structural mechanics and from my masters onwards most of my focus was on Solid mechanics and Programming.
							</p>

							<p align="justify">Through various projects in structural mechanics I touched a vareity of topics focusing on different applications using different operating techniques. Some of the works and the topics are detailed below.</p>

								<h2><li>Strctural - Static & Transient analysis</li></h2>
								<p align="justify">Most materialistic engineering designs are limited by the material properties, especially their ability to carry the load. My focus was to understand the weaklinks in a structure to improve the design and the overall efficiency.</p>
								<p align="justify">For most of the design, static (quasi-static) analysis is sufficient, but as the loading rate increases, the material behaviour could drastically change and it would better to have the transient analysis for these kinds of systems. I was working with the fractura of PMMA (plexy glass) and applied load on the specimens at 10-3/s and 103/s loading rates - as imagined the results were noticebly different and needed seperate analysis for each of them.</p>
								<p align="justify">Another important topic in transient or dynamic analysis is the vibrational or modal analysis where influencial frequencies of the szstem based on the structural and boundary conditions are considered.</p></li></h2>
								<p align="justify">fracture mechanics is another crucial subdivision of structural mechanics, where the sole focus is on the structural failure. The limitations of materials determines the design parameters of a system. New material & damage models are still developed to improve optimize the design aspects.</p>

								<h2><li>Thermo-structural analysis</li></h2>
								<p align="justify">Thermal analysis is as important as the structural analysis in many applications, expecially since they are coulpled in many systems. In addition to the thermal expansion, many material properties are linked to the temperature. So, not considering thermal aspects in an analysis could be ignoring the crucial weaklinks in a system. As an example, currently I am working with electrical motors in which the temperature could rise above 200 0C at different areas in the system. If the thermal expansion is not considered for the design, it could destabilize the rotor, reduce the airgap, increase the loading on bearings..., and any of these could lead to the failure of the motor.</p>
								<p align="justify">Forming of metals is another common method used in industry for the development of most of the systems around us. Common items we see around us in the daily life are mostly made of Sheetmetals which includes a candy box to parts of an aircraft. The sheetmetals are deformed in to various needed shapes by forming where the metal is plastically strained in to the desired shape. I studied and developed some material models to simulate the Forming of sheetmetals. The model considers the role of the environmental parameters such as Temperature and strain rate. The ductile material models is based on the GTN model where the evolution of the material during the plastic deformation is taken in to account more accurately compared to other existing models. The model is useful especially to get higher accuracy while Forming sheetmetals under extreme environment.</p>

								<h2><li>FEA & CAE</li></h2>
								<p align="justify">FEA is a blessing to the engineering world. This numerical tool has accelerated the development cycle in recent decades. Particulary for the initial phase of the design, FEA provides the room to examine various possibilities without relying too much on the experimental/testing techniques. FEA is a numerical tool to solve systems based on a differential equation - this includes analysis based on structural, thermal, fluid, electro-mechanical aspects.</p>

								<p align="justify">There are three major steps involved in the Finite Element Analysis - Pre-processing, Processing and Post-processing. Many softwares are developed to implement the FEA for various engineering applications; some of them are Ansys, Altair, Siemens NX, Comsol, Dassault Systems and Abaqus. These software differ based on the emphasis of engineering fields, ease of handling, options of material models... Many of the softwares are capable of handling coulpled systems which could involve structural analyse, thermal analysis, fluid mechanics and electro-mechanical analysis. An example of such a system is fuel-cell which requires Structural, thermal, fluid dynamics and electro-magnetical analyse. Most of these systems are decoupled in to simpler forms to ease the analyse to reduce the complexity while having enough accuracy. Although FEA has been developed over two decades, there are still room for development, optimization and automization. As one goes deeper to futher understand these numerical tools, more and more areas to expose can be found.</p>

								<p align="justify">The recent emergence of topology optimization and generative design has revolutionized the development process. Currently, to develop a structural component, one has the option of considering various possibilites of the design with certain constraints along with the material and production cost. With the use of topology optimization, it is easy to improve the efficiency of the structural components. In the past decades, with the use of complicated failure models and analysis it was possible to reduce the material use by upto 5 or 8 %. But the topology optimization has modified the playfield by changing this factor by 40 or 50%. Production of this systems was an issue before, but with the upcoming of 3d printing, many of the appliations are possible with topology optimization. Many of the FEA software have implemented these optimization methods and various companies have started development of various systems. An example of this is (Car company) where they acquired a new design philosophy to save time, money and effort. The chassis of the car is developed considering the strength distribution, impact absorbtio during crash, even the electrical wiring in the car. Such a way of design wouldn't be possible without the current developments.</p>

								<h2><li>Material modeling</li></h2>
								<p align="justify">We are surrounded by vareity of materials which responds to different ways for the stimulations. Based on these qualities/constraints, we choose suitable material for a particular design. For a box with good strength and lower cost a metal sheet might be suitable considering the cost and the ease of deformation. While for a pot which is hard and doesn't conduct heat, a brittle material might be preferable. In addition to brittle and ductile materials, there are several catagories based on various aspects of materials. </p>
								<p align="justify"> As these material behaves in different ways, different material models are required to simulate these materials.
								This is a numerical, mention tools. Although from an industrial/application point of view, many of these models are not needed, the same tools and the mind set behind this process would be useful and adapted for various similar design applications. Material modeling is the defintion of how a matrial would behave at a particular environment. </p>
								<p align="justify">Brittle, ductile, composite... are some examples of various materials that are commonly used for various appliations in the industry. Material modeling is partuculary useful when combined with FEA/CAE. Most of the major FEA solvers include a detailed database of various material behaviour. In rare cases, when someone needs to understant a particular material, one has to develop analytical/numerical tool to examine the system.</p>
								<p align="justify">Models, JC, GTN, cohesive, material & damage models.</p>

								<h2><li>Experimental/testing methods and techniques</li></h2>
								<p align="justify">Similar to FEA, there are various tools developed to ease different stages of the anaysis. During my work with brittle and ductime materials, I developed some tools to examine and analyse material behaviours. Some of them are for the data extraction related to the experimentation and some are for the system simulations. </p>
