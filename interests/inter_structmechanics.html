							Solid mechanics covers a vast area of research and engineering, in which I touched some fields in the last 10 years. Most of my focus was on fracture mechanics and material properties under various loading conditions. I had opportunities to study and work with brittle and ductile materials using experimental and numerical methods. My bachelors was in Aerospace engineering which contained mainly four engineering streams - structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, propulsion and flight dynamics - among which a student has to choose and focus on a particular area for masters. I was more inclined to structural mechanics and from my masters onwards most of my focus was on Solid mechanics and Programming.
							</p>

							<p align="justify">Through various projects in structural mechanics I touched a vareity of topics focusing on different applications using different operating techniques. Some of the works and the topics are detailed below.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="content">
							<ol>
								<h2><li>Strctural - Static & Transient analysis</li></h2>
								<p class="justify">Most materialistic engineering designs are limited by the material properties, especially their ability to carry the load. My focus was to understand the weaklinks in a structure to improve the design and the overall efficiency.</p>
								<p class="justify">For most of the design, static (quasi-static) analysis is sufficient, but as the loading rate increases, the material behaviour could drastically change and it would better to have the transient analysis for these kinds of systems. I was working with the fractura of PMMA (plexy glass) and applied load on the specimens at 10-3/s and 103/s loading rates - as imagined the results were noticebly different and needed seperate analysis for each of them.</p>
								<p class="justify">Another important topic in transient or dynamic analysis is the vibrational or modal analysis where influencial frequencies of the szstem based on the structural and boundary conditions are considered.</li></h2>
								<p class="justify">fracture mechanics is an important subdivision of structural mechanics, where the sole focus is on the structural failure.</p>

								<h2><li>Therm0-structural analysis</li></h2>
								<p class="justify">Thermal analysis is as important as the structural analysis in many applications, expecially since they are coulpled in many systems. In addition to the thermal expansion, many material properties are linked to the temperature. So, not considering thermal aspects in an analysis could have failure risks. As an example, currently I am working with electrical motors in which the temperature could rise upto 200 0C at different areas in the system. If the thermal expansion is not considered for the design, it could destabilize the rotor, reduce the airgap, increase the loading on bearings..., and all these could lead to motor failure.</p>
								<p class="justify">Sheetmetals FLD, forming, the limiting curve</p>

								<h2><li>FEA & CAE</li></h2>
								<p class="justify">FEA is a blessing. This numerical tool has accelerated the development cycle in recent decades. Particulary for the initial phase of the design, FEA provides the room to examine various possibilities without relying too much on the experimental/testing techniques. FEA is a numerical tool to solve most of the systems based on a differential equation - this includes analysis based on structural, thermal, fluid, electro-mechanical ... There are various softwares that could deliver different steps of the design, to name some - Ansys, Altair, Siemens NX, Dassault Systems. Since most of the systems consists of multiple physical phenomena, as an example, wind turbine will require both structural and fluid analysis and in this system, they are coulpled. As one goes deeper in to these numerical tools, more and more areas to expose can be found.</p>

								<p class="justify">Linear, non-linear, contact...</p>

								<p class="justify">The recent emergence of topology optimization and generative design has revolutionized the development process. Currently, to develop a structural component, one has the option of considering various possibilites of the design along with the material cost, production cost and the requirements. With the use of topology optimization, it is easy to improve the efficiency of the structural components. In the past decades, with the use of complicated failure models and analysis, it was possible to reduce the material use by upto 5 or 8 %. But the topology optimization has modified the playfield by changing this factor by 40 or 50%. Production of this systems was an issue before, but with the upcoming of 3d printing, many of the appliations are possible with topology optimization.</p>

								<h2><li>Material modeling</li></h2>
								<p class="justify">This is a numerical, mention tools. Although from an industrial/application point of view, many of these models are not needed, the same tools and the mind set behind this process would be useful and adapted for various similar design applications. Material modeling is the defintion of how a matrial would behave at a particular environment. </p>
								<p class="justify">Brittle, ductile, composite... are some examples of various materials that are commonly used for various appliations in the industry. Material modeling is partuculary useful when combined with FEA/CAE. Most of the major FEA solvers include a detailed database of various material behaviour. In rare cases, when someone needs to understant a particular material, one has to develop analytical/numerical tool to examine the system.</p>
								<p class="justify">Models, JC, GTN, cohesive, material & damage models.</p>

								<h2><li>Experimental/testing methods and techniques</li></h2>
								<p class="justify">Similar to FEA, there are various tools developed to ease different stages of the anaysis. During my work with brittle and ductime materials, I developed some tools to examine and analyse material behaviours. Some of them are for the data extraction related to the experimentation and some are for the system simulations. </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Digital Image Correlation (DIC)</li>
								<li>Tools in matlab, Python & Fortran</li>
								<li>Signal processing (FFT)</li>
