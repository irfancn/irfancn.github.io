<!--Introduction-->
								<p align="justify">In order to succeed in the modern engineering world, engineers need to be proficient in using software tools for various applications. Proficiency in software tools such as CAD, FEA, CFD, simulation, project management, and data analysis software is increasingly becoming a requirement for engineers. The ability to effectively utilize these software tools can lead to improved design, simulation, analysis, and optimization of engineering systems and processes.
								</p>

								<p align="justify">Despite the vast amount of software available, most of it costs a lot of money and can only be used by large corporations. Many software companies provide free and limited versions of software tools to students, but this may not be enough for limited applications. In this article, I would like to explore some commonly used applications and possible free software options for them.
								</p>

								<p align="justify">In addition to this, while providing a service, using some of the softwares can be a pain in the ass, especially when it is like a trap, where you can not do certain important aspect with or without the help of the software supplier. Oh! do you want change the file format, then you need an additional package, pay us an 30% more. Oh, you want a floating license with that, then the amount will be tripled. Most of these softwares are priced by looking at the market demand and how much one is willing to pay like in a casino where the house tries to extract howmuchever they can. While free software have their own share if issues, it does have a lot of good qualities that the paid software might lack. In this article, I would like to point out some of the aspects regarding various free software for different engineering applications. Generally, the service and additional packages are a huge portion of the income for the big companies.
								Falls in to an ecosystem. Most of the main software companies aqcuire the small ones and at some level it is much easier to stay in this ecosystem where everything is synced to one anotheer.

<!--Goal-->
									<h2><li id="section_1">Goal</li></h2>
										<p align="justify">The main aim of this article are,
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>To familiarize </li>
											<li>To find a cheaper alternative of main engineering applications</li>
											<li>To know more about the open source softwares</li>
											<li>This has helped to explore a bit about various free softwares.</li>

<!--Softwares and applications-->
									<h2><li id="section_2">Engineering applications and Free software</li></h2>
										<p align="justify">Engineers use software tools to design, simulate, analyze, and optimize various engineering systems and processes. The softwares can be catagorized based on the area of engineering applications.
										</p>

										<h3 id="section_21">2.1 Major Multiphysics domains</h3>
										<p align="justify">Most systems are simplified based on the physical phenomena needs to be observed, since it is much simpler to uncouple these phenomena and examine them separately rather than having a complex system where multiple phenomena are coupled. This way of systematically analysing a system simplifies the system to make the process simpler and faster. Some of the important physical phenomena for a system analysis are,
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Structural mechanics</li>
											<li>Thermal analysis</li>
											<li>Electromagnetics</li>
											<li>Fluid dynamics</li>
											<li>Acoustics</li>
										</ol>

										<h3 id="section_22">2.2 Engineering Techniques/Tools</h3>
										<p align="justify">To tackle the the analysis in the above listed fields, there are many engineering techniques available. Some of the commonly used software tools for engineering applications are:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li align="justify"><b>Computer-Aided Design (CAD):</b> CAD software is used to create 2D and 3D models of engineering components and systems. Engineers use CAD software to design and visualize components, assemblies, and systems before they are built.</li>
											<li align="justify"><b>Finite Element Analysis (FEA):</b> FEA software is used to simulate the behavior of engineering systems under various loading conditions. Engineers use FEA software to analyze stresses, deformations, and other physical phenomena that occur in engineering systems.</li>
											<li align="justify"><b>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD):</b> CFD software is used to simulate the behavior of fluids and gases in engineering systems. Engineers use CFD software to analyze fluid flow, heat transfer, and other physical phenomena that occur in engineering systems.</li>
											<li align="justify"><b>Simulation software:</b> Simulation software is used to simulate the behavior of engineering systems under various conditions. Engineers use simulation software to predict the performance of engineering systems and optimize their design.</li>
											<li align="justify"><b>Project management software:</b> Project management software is used to manage and track engineering projects. Engineers use project management software to keep track of project timelines, budgets, and milestones.</li>
											<li align="justify"><b>Data analysis software:</b> Data analysis software is used to analyze and interpret data collected from engineering systems. Engineers use data analysis software to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in data, and to make informed decisions based on the results.</li>
										</ul>

										<p align="justify">In addition, there are commonly used softwares like Matlab which has almost all the packages required for an engineer such as programming, image processing, optimization and control systems ...

<!--Advantages and disadvantages of softwares-->
									<h2><li id="section_3">Comparison - Free & Paid software</li></h2>
										<p align="justify">For most of the listed engineering techniques there is a vast vareity of softwares out there. Normally people choose them considering various parameters such as cost, area of application, compatibility with existing system... etc. Most of the industries use paid version of the software considering some of the aforementioned factors.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">In addition to this, there is a world of free softwares which most of us are unaware of. The selection criteria for the free softwares could vary from that of the paid versions. Below is some of the comparison of some of the general aspects one considers for the selection of a software. Most of these comparisons are general, since the experience of each person with each software are subjective, most these comparisons are general, not specific to a particular software.
